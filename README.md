# Maze Game (Python, AI/ML)

A maze-solving project built in Python, developed as part of the **HarvardX: CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python** course on edX.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview
This program generates and solves mazes using **search algorithms**.  
The AI agent navigates from a start point to a goal point while avoiding walls and dead ends.

---

## 🛠️ Features
- Maze generation from text files
- Solving mazes using **Depth-First Search (DFS)** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- Step-by-step visualization of the solution path
- Handles both simple and complex maze structures

---

## 📚 What I Learned
- Representing environments as **state-space problems**
- Implementing graph search algorithms (DFS, BFS)
- Building a simple **AI agent** for pathfinding
- Debugging and testing algorithms on different datasets
